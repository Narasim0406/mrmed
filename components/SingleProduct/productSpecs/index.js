                    It is used for the treatment and prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD).
                    It also helps in restoring the normal microbial flora of the intestine. It
                    is useful in the treatment as well as prevention of various infections like
                    gastroenteritis (also known as infectious diarrhea) and intestinal disorders
                    which include aphthous ulcers, stomatitis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and 
                    inflammatory bowel disorders (IBD). It is also recommended for treating
                    travelersâ€™ diarrhea. It contains Streptococcus faecalis,
                    Clostridium butyricum, Bacillus mesentericus and Lactobacillus sporogenes
                    as major active ingredients. These act as probiotics that help in restoring
                    the balance of good bacteria in the intestine that may get upset after
                    antibiotic use or due to intestinal infections. It works by inhibiting or decreasing
                    the growth of harmful microorganisms in the gut.
